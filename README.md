# Brain Tumor Detection with 3D Visualization

This project is an advanced, web-based AI application designed for the medical field, specifically for hospitals and clinics. Its primary function is to detect brain tumors from medical scans (such as MRI or CT scans).

A key feature of this application is its **3D visualization capability**. Instead of just analyzing a 2D slice, the system reconstructs the detected tumor and surrounding brain area into an interactive 3D model. This allows doctors, surgeons, and radiologists to better understand the tumor's size, shape, volume, and exact position, which is critical for diagnosis and surgical planning.

## Key Features

* **AI-Powered Detection:** Utilizes a Deep Learning model to accurately identify and segment brain tumors from scan images.
* **Interactive 3D Visualization:** Renders the detected tumor in a 3D space, allowing users to zoom, pan, and rotate the model for detailed examination.
* **Web-Based Interface:** Easily accessible from any hospital workstation via a standard web browser, requiring no complex local software installation.
* **User-Friendly Dashboard:** Designed with medical professionals in mind, focusing on clarity, ease of use, and efficient workflow.
